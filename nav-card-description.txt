# Nav Card - Robot Navigation Strategy Game

## 1. Project Overview
Nav Card is a 2D strategy game that combines card selection with algorithm-driven robot navigation. Players choose three algorithm cards before starting each stage: one for navigation, one for collision avoidance, and one for recovery behavior. The selected algorithms dictate how the in-game robot navigates a dynamic environment filled with obstacles and hazards. The goal is to complete the stage within a set limit of recovery attempts and/or by beating the best time, with leaderboards to compare performances.

## 2. Project Review
Most robot navigation simulations are designed for technical users and lack the accessibility needed for beginners to understand how different algorithms work. This project aims to:
- **Enhance Learning**: By visualizing how different navigation algorithms perform in real-time
- **Increase Interactivity**: By allowing players to experiment with different algorithm combinations
- **Improve Understanding**: Through a card-based interface that makes complex algorithmic concepts more approachable

## 3. Programming Development

### 3.1 Game Concept
The game simulates robot navigation through obstacle-filled environments. The primary objective is to reach the goal position with minimal recovery attempts and in the shortest time possible. The game integrates traditional navigation algorithms with a card-based selection system to make learning these concepts fun and interactive.

### 3.2 Object-Oriented Programming Implementation
The project is structured into separate components:

**Game Manager**:
- **Role**: Manages overall game flow (board state, user input, turn switching, and statistics tracking)
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `stage`: Current level the player is attempting
  - `camera_y`: Controls the view between card selection and gameplay areas
  - `running`: Tracks if the game is currently active
- **Key Methods**: `run()`, `update()`, `handle_events()`, and `draw()`

**Card Deck**:
- **Role**: Handles the collection of algorithm cards and their interactions
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `cards`: List of available algorithm cards
  - `preview_mode`: Tracks whether cards are displayed in fan-out view
  - `game_stage`: Indicates whether gameplay has started (vs. card selection phase)
- **Key Methods**: `reset_cards()`, `handle_events()`, `update()`, and `draw()`

**Card (Base Class)**:
- **Role**: Defines common attributes and methods for algorithm cards
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `card_type`: Type of algorithm (Navigation, Collision avoidance, Recovery)
  - `card_name`: Specific algorithm name (e.g., A*, DWA)
  - `position`: Current position on screen
  - `dragging`: Whether the card is being dragged
- **Key Methods**: `draw()`, `update_dragging()`, `contains_point()`, `set_preview_mode()`

**Stage**:
- **Role**: Manages the playfield area, card slots, and game environment
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `slots`: Card placement slots for the three algorithm types
  - `buttons`: Interactive buttons (start, reset)
  - `background`: Game environment background
- **Key Methods**: `draw()`, `handle_mouse_motion()`, `place_card()`, `handle_button_click()`
